# AssemblyLine Documentation

The AssemblyLine development process and library for developing online legal easy forms.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Install

```console
npm install
```

## Local Development

## Build

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

```console
npm run build
```

## Run locally

This command runs `npm run build`, then starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server:

```console
npm run start
```

## Deploy

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=TRUE npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
