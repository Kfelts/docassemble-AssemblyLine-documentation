Write in a way that respects your reader. Do not tell your reader how to think or feel.
Respect the perspective that they bring to using your legal form.

## Avoid using 'please'

Omit the word "please" when asking for information. For example, use "Describe"
instead of "Please describe".

## Use "need" not "want" when referring to the protections or relief the plaintiff requests

When someone goes to court it's because they **need** something, not want it.
Using the word "want" can be dismissive of the plaintiff's goals and objectives.

## Avoid adverbs, especially intensifiers, where possible (e.g. 'very')

Intensifiers weaken instead of strengthen our arguments. Use facts to persuade
instead.
