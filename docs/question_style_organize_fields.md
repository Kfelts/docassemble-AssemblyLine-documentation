## Ask for only a few fields on each screen

A good rule of thumb is to ask for no more than about 5 pieces of information on
each screen. However: each screen should have a logical collection of related
fields. If you have more than 5 very closely related pieces of information, you
could bend this rule.

## Where possible, ask short follow-up questions on the same screen

Use a field on the same screen to ask your user for follow-up information when:

1. the field is short
1. it relates directly to the answer the user just provided

Example:

1. Are you married?
    - What is your spouse's name?
