<!-- original: https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/doc-assembly-line/blob/master/README.md -->

An easy-form assembly line development process to more quickly and effectively create mobile-friendly online court easy-forms and _pro se_ materials for key areas of urgent legal need.

We're operating out of [Suffolk Law's Legal Innovation and Technology Lab](https://suffolklitlab.org/) in cooperation with the Massachusetts [Access to Justice Commission](http://www.massa2j.org/a2j/)'s COVID-19 task force. Though we're focused on MA specific content, we're sharing our work here on GitHub in the hopes that our efforts can be replicated in other jurisdictions. All novel code we generate will be licensed under an [MIT License](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/doc-assembly-line/blob/master/LICENSE), and we're intentionally building on the open source [docassemble](https://docassemble.org/) platform. Here's [what we're doing](https://suffolklitlab.org/doc-assembly-line/#doing), and [how you can help](https://suffolklitlab.org/doc-assembly-line/#help).
