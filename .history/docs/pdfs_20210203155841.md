# Tips for working with PDF files

If the form was created in Adobe Live Cycle, you will not be able to add form
fields that are compatible with Docassemble. A simple workaround is to print the
file to PDF. There is a built-in PDF driver in Chrome and in Windows 10, and one
also comes with Mac OS X and with Microsoft Office.

You cannot use the Adobe print driver to print a Live Cycle form to PDF. It must
be a third-party driver. A commercial freeware option is [BullZip
PDF](https://www.bullzip.com/products/pdf/info.php).

A GPL-licensed alternative is
[GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/download.html).

## Advanced troubleshooting

If you run into a problem with the PDF, the PDF might be corrupted in some way.
This happens infrequently but often enough to be troublesome.

Two methods you might try:

1. Run the PDF through [Documate](https://www.documate.org/pdf)'s PDF unlocker.
   This can fix some PDF issues and is quick and easy.
2. Try the [QPDF](http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/) tool, a command line tool that can fix more broken PDFs.
