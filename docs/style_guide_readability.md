Write with clarity and simplicity. Below are some rules that can help make your writing easier to understand.
## Write in active voice, not passive voice
It can be a difficult concept to describe, but this convention can be very helpful.

Below, you can see a summary of some useful articulations found in [this article about the topic from the University of Arizona writing center](https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/active-vs-passive-voice).

### Tips to locate and avoid passive voice?
**Does it make sense?**

If you can say the subject, action, and object in the order they appear in the sentence and it makes sense, you have written in active voice. For instance, you can say "Sally drove car" [re: Sally drove the car off the cliff] and can understand the meaning. However, if you say "Car driven Sally" [re: The car was driven off the cliff by Sally] it does not make sense; this scenario would indicate that you wrote the sentence in passive voice.

**Look for "by" phrases**

For example, "by Sally" or "by the dog" might be a sign that the sentence is passive voice.

**Look for a form of "be"**

Look for words like is, was, were, are, or been. These words might signal passive voice.

## Write out "or" rather than using `/` to separate related concepts or and/or
Avoid "and/or" all together. Avoid  this Janus-faced term. It can often be
replaced by "and" or "or" with no loss in meaning.

If you think the "and/or" concept is important in a sentence, use this format
instead: "Option one **or** option 2 **or** both." For example, use "Take a
sleeping pill **or** a warm drink, **or** both." Do think about other
possibilities. For example, "Take a sleeping pill, maybe with a warm drink."

Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch05/psec250.html)


### Avoid using 'please'
Omit the word "please" when asking for information. For example, use "Describe" instead of "Please describe".


### Use "need" not "want" when referring to the protections or relief the plaintiff requests
When someone goes to court it's because they **need** something, not want it. The word "need" is more empowering.


### Avoid adverbs, especially intensifiers, where possible (e.g. 'very')
Intensifiers weaken instead of strengthen our arguments. Use facts to persuade instead.

See [https://sites.utexas.edu/legalwriting/2017/01/17/intensifiers-part-2-replace-and-specify/](https://sites.utexas.edu/legalwriting/2017/01/17/intensifiers-part-2-replace-and-specify/) 


### Avoid contractions (can't, don't)
Write out the words instead, like "cannot" or "do not".


### Avoid idioms ('get the hang of it', 'sit tight')
Other examples: Up in the air, on the ball, rule of thumb.


### Use simple words
See [the United States government's table showing how to simplify words](https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/use-simple-words-phrases/)

Below is a shortened version of the list. Whenever it is possible, replace the words in the left column with the words in the right column.

| Replace this | Use this |
|:-|:-|
| obtain | get |
| receive | get |
| whether | if |
| such as | like |
| provide | give |
| assist | help |

### Say what to do. Avoid saying what not to do.
It is usually easier to understand rules as a positive rather than a negative.

Examples:

**Avoid:** Be careful not to leave information out of your description.

**Use:** Use lots of details in your description.


### Ask one question at a time

A compound question asks the user to answer more than one thing in the same question. 

Examples:

**Avoid:** Do you currently have a case in the Probate and Family Court or are you planning to file one?

**Consider:** Tell us about your cases

- [ ] I have a case in the Probate and Family Court now.

- [ ] I am planning to file a case in the Probate and Family Court.
