This guide is written to help authors designing "guided interviews", or
interactive legal applications, for any platform.

It will help you understand:

* which questions to include
* how to write them well
* how to group and organize them into screens
* how to add supporting content, like next steps

We have tried to pull out a list of actionable tips, especially where
those tips might be different in the context of guided interviews compared to
more general guidance about good legal writing and good writing for forms.

We have also thought deeply about how to **measure** the burden that completing
a form places on a user. You might find our section on [form complexity](complexity/complexity.md) helpful to read along with this section.
